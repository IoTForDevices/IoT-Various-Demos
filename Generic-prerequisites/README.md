# Generic Prerequisites
This folder contains a number of pre-requisites that need to be in place before actual demo's can be executed. Different demo's require different pre-requisites although often they are re-used by multiple demo's. That is the reason to have a separate section with pre-requisites. Some of them are time consuming and need to be ready before running on-stage demo's. Therefor most of them also contain an estimated time to execute.

The following pre-requisites are available (click the links for detailed instructions):
