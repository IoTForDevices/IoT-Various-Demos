# ASAEdgeTiltJob Explained
The ASAEdgeTiltJob is an Azure Stream Analytics Job that will run in a container locally on the Edge. It will take input from a leaf device that is continuously sending pitch and roll telemetry data from which tilt is calculated through a user defined function (UDF), written in C#. The calculated tilt value is then send to the [anomalydetection_spikeanddip](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/stream-analytics-query/anomalydetection-spikeanddip-azure-stream-analytics) function, one of the built-in machine learning based anomaly detection capabilities in Azure Stream Analytics that can be used to monitor the two most commonly occurring anomalies: temporary and persistent.
It will send the original values for pitch and roll, together with a time stamp and calculated pitch as well as obtained score and anomaly detection to the output alias.
